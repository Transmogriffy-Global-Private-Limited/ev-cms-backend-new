### Lean CMS foundation started

- Replaced the empty scaffold concept with a documented multi-tenant CPO CMS
  boundary.
- Kept the OCPP HAL explicitly separate from the CMS and deferred the handshake
  contract to the relevant implementation phase.
- Chose fixed CPO-wide roles instead of custom RBAC or per-hub scopes.
- Defined the initial platform-admin, user, CPO membership, and customer data
  model.
- Added versioned migration, database startup, and health-service foundations.
- Recorded custom roles, plan entitlements, RLS, event infrastructure, charging,
  and finance as deferred work rather than speculative implementation.

Verification:

- Go formatting completed.
- `go test ./...` passed.
- `go vet ./...` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- PostgreSQL migration integration remains unverified because no explicitly
  selected disposable development database was used.

### Complete supplied CMS schema restored

- Corrected the initial over-simplification that omitted most supplied CMS
  domain data.
- Added user settings, tenant user groups, hubs, chargers, connectors, group
  access links, customer favorites, GST profiles, tariffs, wallets, wallet
  transactions, charging sessions, payments, and audit logs.
- Preserved CPO profile data on the CPO tenant and mapped app users to
  tenant-scoped customer records.
- Added CPO identifiers and tenant-matching foreign keys throughout the owned
  domain.
- Added exact-decimal Go types and PostgreSQL numeric fields for finance.
- Added matching `000001_cms_schema.up.sql` and
  `000001_cms_schema.down.sql` migrations.
- Added an explicit latest-migration rollback operation and migration command.
- Added tests for complete table coverage, up/down pairing, JSONB behavior, and
  GORM model parsing.

Verification:

- Focused migration, model, JSONB, and constants tests passed.
- `go test ./...` passed.
- `go vet ./...` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- PostgreSQL 17 up migration created all 21 domain tables.
- A second up run was idempotent and retained one migration version.
- Down migration removed all domain tables and retained only
  `schema_migrations`.
- The loopback-only disposable PostgreSQL instance was stopped and its local
  test directory was removed.
